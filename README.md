## 👤 Bio / About Me

I’m a proud husband, father, and dog dad to a Goldendoodle named Coco. I believe business is personal—relationships matter, handwritten notes still count, and consistency beats perfection. I’m also a lifelong learner, currently diving into Python programming, neuroplasticity, and time mastery. I practice daily reflection, use the Pomodoro Technique, and champion meditation as a business tool.
